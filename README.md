# 🚀 Genvis: The All-in-One Generative AI Hub

Welcome to Genvis, a multi-functional web application built with Streamlit that harnesses the power of Google's Gemini models. This app serves as a central dashboard to interact with generative AI in various ways, from conversational chat and image analysis to in-depth document Q&A.

## ✨ Features

Genvis is organized into several key modules, accessible from the sidebar:

* **💬 Chat with Gemini:** A conversational chatbot interface powered by the Gemini Pro model. Ask questions, brainstorm ideas, write code, or get summaries of complex topics.
* **🖼️ Image Playground:** Leverages the Gemini Pro Vision model to understand and analyze images. You can upload an image and ask questions about it, such as "What's happening in this picture?" or "Extract the text from this sign."
* **📄 PDF-based Q&A:** A powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. You can upload your own PDF document, and the app will:
    1.  Extract the text.
    2.  Break it into intelligent chunks.
    3.  Convert those chunks into vector embeddings.
    4.  Store them in a vector database.
    
    You can then ask specific questions, and the AI will answer based *only* on the content of your document.
